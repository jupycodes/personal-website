<p class="paragraph">I work as an engineer in the oil & gas industry and am also studying web development. I live in Calgary, AB with my fiance and our pets. In my spare time, I love going to the mountains for some skiing or mountain biking (depending on the season). I also love to unwind in the gym, with a goal to compete in olympic weightlifting at a provincial level this year.</p>
